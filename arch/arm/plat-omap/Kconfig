	select VIRTIO_RING
	select OMAP_MBOX_FWK
	help
	  Say Y if you want to enable OMAP virtio-based remote-processor
	  communication, currently only available with OMAP4. This is required
	  for offloading tasks to the remote on-chip M3s or C64x+ dsp,
	  usually used by multimedia frameworks to offload cpu-intensive and/or
          latency-sensitive tasks.

config OMAP_RPMSG_RECOVERY
	bool "OMAP RPMSG recovery"
	default y
	depends on OMAP_RPMSG
	help
	  Say Y if you want RPMSG to reset the rpmsg channels after a fatal
	  error in remote proc. That way it will restart all the channels and
	  the remote processor, causing a clean restart.

config OMAP_SMARTREFLEX
	bool "SmartReflex support"
	depends on (ARCH_OMAP3 || ARCH_OMAP4) && PM
	help
	  Say Y if you want to enable SmartReflex.

	  SmartReflex can perform continuous dynamic voltage
	  scaling around the nominal operating point voltage
	  according to silicon characteristics and operating
	  conditions. Enabling SmartReflex reduces power
	  consumption.

	  Please note, that by default SmartReflex is only
	  initialized. To enable the automatic voltage
	  compensation for vdd mpu  and vdd core from user space,
	  user must write 1 to
		/debug/voltage/vdd_<X>/smartreflex/autocomp,
	  where X is mpu or core for OMAP3.
	  Optionally autocompensation can be enabled in the kernel
	  by default during system init via the enable_on_init flag
	  which an be passed as platform data to the smartreflex driver.

config OMAP_SMARTREFLEX_CLASS3
	bool "Class 3 mode of Smartreflex Implementation"

	depends on OMAP_SMARTREFLEX
	help
	  Say Y to enable Class 1.5 implementation of Smartreflex.

	int "Class 1.5 mode recalibration recalibration delay(ms)"
	depends on OMAP_SMARTREFLEX_CLASS1P5
	default 86400000
	help
	  Setup the recalibration delay in milliseconds.

	  Use 0 for never doing a recalibration (operates in AVS Class 1 mode).
	  Defaults to recommended recalibration every 24hrs.
	  If you do not understand this, use the default.

config OMAP_RESET_CLOCKS
	bool "Reset unused clocks during boot"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP
	help
	  Say Y if you want to reset unused clocks during boot.
	  This option saves power, but assumes all drivers are
	  using the clock framework. Broken drivers that do not
	  yet use clock framework may not work with this option.
	  If you are booting from another operating system, you
	  probably do not want this option enabled until your
	  device drivers work properly.

config OMAP_MUX
	bool "OMAP multiplexing support"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP
	default y
	help
	  Pin multiplexing support for OMAP boards. If your bootloader
	  sets the multiplexing correctly, say N. Otherwise, or if unsure,
	  say Y.

config OMAP_MUX_DEBUG
	bool "Multiplexing debug output"
	depends on OMAP_MUX
	help
	  Makes the multiplexing functions print out a lot of debug info.
	  This is useful if you want to find out the correct values of the
	  multiplexing registers.

config OMAP_MUX_WARNINGS
	bool "Warn about pins the bootloader didn't set up"
	depends on OMAP_MUX
	default y
	help
	  Choose Y here to warn whenever driver initialization logic needs
	  to change the pin multiplexing setup.	 When there are no warnings
	  printed, it's safe to deselect OMAP_MUX for your product.

config OMAP_MCBSP
	bool "McBSP support"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here if you want support for the OMAP Multichannel
	  Buffered Serial Port.

config OMAP_MBOX_FWK
	bool "Mailbox framework support"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to use OMAP Mailbox framework support for
	  DSP, IVA1.0 and IVA2 in OMAP1/2/3.

config OMAP_MBOX_KFIFO_SIZE
	int "Mailbox kfifo default buffer size (bytes)"
	depends on OMAP_MBOX_FWK
	default 256
	help
	  Specify the default size of mailbox's kfifo buffers (bytes).
	  This can also be changed at runtime (via the mbox_kfifo_size
	  module parameter).

config OMAP_MPU_TIMER
	bool "Use mpu timer"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP1
	help
	  Select this option if you want to use the OMAP mpu timer. This

	  but consumes more power.

config OMAP_32K_TIMER
	bool "Use 32KHz timer"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP16XX || ARCH_OMAP2PLUS
	default y if (ARCH_OMAP16XX || ARCH_OMAP2PLUS)
	help
	  Select this option if you want to enable the OMAP 32KHz timer.
	  This timer saves power compared to the OMAP_MPU_TIMER, and has
	  support for no tick during idle. The 32KHz timer provides less
	  intra-tick resolution than OMAP_MPU_TIMER. The 32KHz timer is
	  currently only available for OMAP16XX, 24XX, 34XX and OMAP4.
