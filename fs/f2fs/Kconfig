config F2FS_FS
	tristate "F2FS filesystem support"
	depends on BLOCK
	default n
	help
	  F2FS is based on Log-structured File System (LFS), which supports
	  versatile "flash-friendly" features. The design has been focused on
	  addressing the fundamental issues in LFS, which are snowball effect
	  of wandering tree and high cleaning overhead.

	  Since flash-based storages show different characteristics according to
	  the internal geometry or flash memory management schemes there are
	  support to various parameters not only for configuring on-disk layout,
	  but also for selecting allocation and cleaning algorithms.

	  If unsure, say N.

config F2FS_STAT_FS
	bool "F2FS Status Information"
	depends on F2FS_FS && DEBUG_FS
	default n
	help
	  /sys/kernel/debug/f2fs/ contains information about all the partitions
	  mounted as f2fs. Each file shows the whole f2fs information.

	  /sys/kernel/debug/f2fs/status includes:
	    - major file system information managed by f2fs currently
	    - average SIT information about whole segments
	    - current memory footprint consumed by f2fs.

config F2FS_FS_XATTR
	bool "F2FS extended attributes"
	depends on F2FS_FS
	default y
	help
	  Extended attributes are name:value pairs associated with inodes by
	  the kernel or by users

	  (see the attr(5) man page, or visit <http://acl.bestbits.at/> for details).

	  If unsure, say N.

config F2FS_FS_POSIX_ACL
	bool "F2FS Access Control Lists"
	depends on F2FS_FS_XATTR
	select FS_POSIX_ACL
	default y
	help
	  Posix Access Control Lists (ACLs) support permissions for users and
	  gourps beyond the owner/group/world scheme.

	  If you don't know what Access Control Lists are, say N

config F2FS_FS_SECURITY
	bool "F2FS Security Labels"
	depends on F2FS_FS_XATTR
	default y
	help
	  Security labels provide an access control facility to support Linux
	  Security Models (LSMs) accepted by SELinux.

	  This option enables an extended attribute handler for file security
	  labels, so that it requires extended attribute support.

	  If you are not using a security module, say N.

config F2FS_CHECK_FS
	bool "F2FS consistency check feature"
	depends on F2FS_FS
	default n
	help
	  Enables BUG_ONs which check the file system consistency in runtime.

	  Enabling this option reduces performance.
