config REMOTE_PROC_AUTOSUSPEND
	bool "Autosuspend support for remoteproc"
	depends on REMOTE_PROC
	default y
	help
          Say Y here if you want remote processor to suspend
          after some time of inactivity.

# can't be tristate, due to omap_device_* and omap_hwmod_* dependency
config OMAP_REMOTE_PROC
	bool "OMAP remoteproc support"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP4
	select OMAP_IOMMU
	select REMOTE_PROC
	default y
	help
	  Say y here to support OMAP's remote processors (dual M3
	  and DSP on OMAP4) via the remote processor framework.

	  Currently only supported on OMAP4.

	  Usually you want to say y here, in order to enable multimedia
	  use-cases to run on your platform (multimedia codecs are
	  offloaded to remote DSP processors using this framework).

	  It's safe to say n here if you're not interested in multimedia
	  offloading or just want a bare minium kernel.

config OMAP_REMOTE_PROC_IPU
	bool "OMAP remoteproc support for IPU"
	depends on OMAP_REMOTE_PROC
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to enable OMAP's IPU remote processor.

	  This option controls only the dual M3 processor sub-system. You
	  would want to say y here usually, as this is the sub-system where
	  typically video & imaging codec control s/w is offloaded.

config OMAP_REMOTE_PROC_DSP
	bool "OMAP remoteproc support for DSP"
	depends on OMAP_REMOTE_PROC
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to enable OMAP's DSP remote processor.

	  This option controls only the DSP processor sub-system. DSP would
	  typically be used to offload audio codecs or other advanced
	  processing algorithms.

config OMAP_RPRES
	bool "Remote Processor Resources"
	depends on OMAP_REMOTE_PROC
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to use OMAP remote processor resources
	  frame work.

config REMOTEPROC_WATCHDOG
	bool "OMAP remoteproc watchdog timer"
	depends on REMOTE_PROC
	default y
	help
	  Say y to enable watchdog timer for remote cores

config REMOTEPROC_CORE_DUMP
	bool "Support for extracting a core dump from a remote processor"
	depends on REMOTE_PROC
	default y
	help
	  Say y to enable extracting a core dump from a running remote
          processor at <debugfs>/remoteproc/<remoteproc>/core.  Extracting the
	  core dump does not pause the remote processor--this must be
	  implemented separately.
